This directory contains code to deal with Kofax KFS Web Services.

For the most part, it was generated using the online SudZC tool at sudzc.com.

The contents of /Soap and /TouchXML contain no code specific to this application, though



Using the code in this folder requires the app link to the CoreConfiguration framework and libxml2.

To add a new service:

- Go to sudzc.com and generate the code for the service (objective-C for iOS - WITH auto ref count)
  Use the prefix "KFX".
  something like: http://63.110.241.21/KFS/axis2/services/UserLoginService?wsdl  
  

- From the zip/source/generated, copy everything into prj/KofaxServices that isn't already there
  (result definitions and the like might already be there for another service)
  
- Edit KFXServices.h/.m to include the new service.

- In [NewServiceName].m/.h:
  If the request involves array fields, they get done wrong and you have to fix 'em. See KfxWscindexField
